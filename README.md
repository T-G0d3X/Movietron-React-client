## *Description*

 Client-side for an application called Movietron based on its existing server-side code I built before as one of my projects ([REST API and database](https://github.com/T-G0d3X/Movietron-API)). Movietron-React-client is a single-page application (SPA), built using React libary, using state routing to navigate between views.
